# 📚 Data Engineering & Machine Learning Pipelines

This repository is an **index of my end-to-end data projects** — covering data engineering pipelines, analytical dashboards, and lightweight machine learning models.  
Each project demonstrates **real-world workflows**: from data extraction and validation to transformation, visualization, and predictive modeling.
